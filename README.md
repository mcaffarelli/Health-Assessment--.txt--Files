# Hospital-.txt--Files

I wrote this program to demonstrate my ability to read and write to .txt files in Java. The program can read patient data from a text file and populate the user interface. It also can let the user know if that patient data is within a normal range or if the patient data is out of range. The program will also allow the data entered to be saved and written to a text file. 


Please see screenshots of program below:

I put 'Michael' for patient name and then clicked 'Get Patient Data'. This is reading a text file that is already created with the title michael.txt. Once 'Get Results' is clicked the information is populated with the michael.txt data. It will also display if the information is normal or out of range.

Next, I entered 'Christina' for file name and clicked Save Report. This will create a new text file with the name Christina and populate it with the data on the UI.

This is the text file that was created under the name 'christina.txt.'
